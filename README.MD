# Badger <img src="https://badger.worldwidepixel.ca/img/badger.png" height=24>
This is badger, a website where you can easily generate [Devin's Badges](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges)-like badges.

![Welcome to Badger](https://badger.worldwidepixel.ca/img/samples/cozy.png)
## Why?
Badges are really useful in many projects. Devin's Badges is a popular choice in Modrinth, for example, but they've been discontinued.

With Badger you can make your own badges and download or embed them.

Just a quick warning: Badger's `data:` URIs are MASSIVE. (thanks base64!)


## How to use it?
It's really simple to use Badger. You choose some colors, an image, type some text and choose the text's color, and a live preview of the finished badges appear in the right side of the page
